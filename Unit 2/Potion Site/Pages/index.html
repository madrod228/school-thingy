    <h1>Potion Riddle</h1>
    <h2>Setting the Scene</h2>
    <p>You are almost finished with your quest. You come upon a room with 6 different sized bottles. Each is filled with a different potion. They are arranged from smallest to largest. You know you need to move forward, but do not see any doors. Upon further inspection, you see a peice of paper with some instructions.</p>
    <h2>The Instructions</h2>
    <p>One among us will let you move ahead.</p>
    <p>Another will transport the drinker back instead.</p>
    <p>Two among our number hold only nettle wine.</p>
    <p>Two of us are killers,waiting hidden in line</p>
    <h2>The Clues</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, however slyly the poison tries to hide, You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side;</li>
        <li>Second, different are those who stand at either end, But if you would move onwards, neither is your friend;</li>
        <li>Third, as you see clearly, all are different size, Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;</li>
        <li>Fourth, the second left and the second on the right Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.</li>
        <li>Finally, if you won’t move forward and decide that you are done, There is enough in it’s container to help only one.</li>
    </ol>
