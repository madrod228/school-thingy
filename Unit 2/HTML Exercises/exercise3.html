<!-- 
Heading Sizes

Headings can come in different sizes. In this page, there are six different sized headings, but they are all mixed up. Can you and your partner figure out how to fix them?

Do This:

1. Open the page in the Live Server.

2. Use the inspect tool to figure out what makes the headings different sizes

3. Make sure you and your partner agree on what the different heading tags do.

4. Change the TAGS so that the headings are in order from biggest to smallest.
