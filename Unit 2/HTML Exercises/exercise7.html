    Not all errors in the code actually impact the page.  This is
    because the browser is "smart enough" to look at code with errors
    in it and make its best guess about what the author intended.

    The code below displays exactly as the author intended, but Visual Studio Code is flagging errors in red.  It is still important to fix these errors because if the page is updated in the future, these errors might cause the page to not display properly. (not to mention you never want to upload code with errors regardless!)

    <h1>Types of Chocolate</h1>
    <p>This page will explain differences between milk, dark, and Ruby chocolate.</p>
    <h2>Milk</h2>
    <p>Milk chocolate is solid chocolate made with either liquid milk, powdered milk, or condensed milk. </p>
    <h2>Dark</h2>
    <p>Unlike milk chocolate, dark chocolate contains no milk in it, instead using more cocoa, giving it a darker color and making it more bitter.</p>
    <h2>Ruby</h2>
    <p>Ruby chocolate is made from a different cocoa bean altogether. It is made from the ruby cocoa bean, which has a red color and different flavor.</p>
