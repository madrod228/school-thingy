    <h2>What is a div element?</h2>
    <p>A div element is a generic html element that has no inherent meaning.  Divs are often used to group related content together.  This means that a div will almost always contain other HTML elements as its content.  Therefore a div should open on one line, leave room for the inner elements, and then close on its own line.  When we learn CSS, there are some styles that need to be applied to the CONTAINER of an element rather than the element itself.  This container is often a div.  A div is a "block level" element (we will discuss what this means later).  </p>
    <p>A div puts the content within it inside an "invisible box" of sorts.  We will talk more about this box when we talk about CSS.</p>
</div>



    <!-- After you have wrapped the content in a div, check the browser to see what it looks like.  Notice that nothing seems to have changed.  This is what we mean when we say that a div does not add any content / style all on its own.  Follow Mr. DelValle's instructions to view the "invisible box" created by the div. -->
