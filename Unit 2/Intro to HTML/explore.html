		<h1>Let's learn SAND!</h1>
		<h2>This is a web page</h2>
		<h1>This webpage is all about SAND</h1>
		<p>You are looking at an actual web page written in HTML, the language of the web. In Visual Studio Code you can see the code used by your computer to create this page.</p>
		<h2>Inspector Tool</h2>
		<p>Use the Inspector tool to see what pieces of code are linked to what text on the web page. To do this, right click (control + click) anywhere on the page and select "Inspect".  Once you turn on the inspector tool, you can hover over any piece of code and the corresponding content will be highlighted on the web page. </p> 

        <p>Go through it with a partner so you can discuss what you're seeing.</p>
        <p>Ignore everything under "Code injected by live-server"</p>
		<h2>Discuss</h2>
		<p>With a friend discuss the following questions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>What text is appearing in both the code and the web page?</li>
			<li>What text is appearing in both the code, but NOT the web page?</li>
			<li>How is this language communicating extra information about the way to represent text?</li>
		</ul>
