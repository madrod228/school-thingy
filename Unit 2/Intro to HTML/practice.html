<!-- 
    1. There are several tags that are universally important when using HTML.  There is a shortcut for this in Visual Studio Code, but everyone should type them by hand at least once.  Follow along with the instructions in class to create these tags.  Do that UNDER this comment section (so under the green arrow at the bottom of all of this green text).

    2. Open the Live Server. (Right click on the page and choose open live server OR press command+L followed by command+O)

    3. Write three separate sentences about any topic you like inside of the body tags of your web page.  DO NOT include any tags other then the ones that were generated together .

    4. Save your changes by pressing command+S to view your changes in the live server.

    5. Compare your work with a neighbor.  Make sure you're placing code in the same place.

    6. Place the text you just wrote inside at least two spearate paragraphs by surrounding it with <p> and </p> tags.

    7. Compare the results with your neighbor.  What has changed about the way your text is displayed?
