    What is a paragraph element?
        Paragraphs are marked by opening "p-tags" <p> and closing "p-tags" </p>.  Paragraphs in HTML can be any length of text from one word to a bunch of sentences.  Paragraphs group together sets of sentences and put some psace between that group of text and the next group of text.
    
    Why does HTML seem to work even when it's broken?
        HTML is read by your web browser to generate web pages.  Since people often make little mistakes when writing their web pages, browsers are programmed to make a best guess of what you intended to do.  Sometimes different browsers are even programmed to make different guesses!   The only way to ensure your code looks like you intend is make sure you're always using tags correctly.

    Why does the code sometimes turn red?
        Visual Studio Code is programmed to automatically detect some mistakes in HTML.  When it notices a mistake, it turns that code red.  The mistake might be in red, or it might be somewhere before the red code  You'll need to carefully debug to find your mistake.
